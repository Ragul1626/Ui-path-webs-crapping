# UiPath - Web Scraping Workflow
## name:ragul M
This repository contains a simple **UiPath workflow** that demonstrates:
- **Extracting structured data** from a website automatically
- **Exporting the scraped data** into an **Excel file**

---

## Project Overview
- Built using **UiPath Studio**
- Demonstrates usage of **Table Extraction** (formerly **Data Scraping**) and **Excel Write Range**
- A beginner-friendly project to learn **web automation** and **data export** with UiPath

---

## Project Files
- `Main.xaml` → The main workflow file
- `ScrapedData.xlsx` → Excel file where the scraped data is stored
- `project.json` → Project configuration
- `.screenshots/` → Auto-generated by UiPath (if any)

---

## Workflow Logic

### 🔹 Table Extraction
- Opens the target website in a browser (e.g. Chrome/Edge)
- Uses **Table Extraction Wizard** to identify and extract structured data (e.g., product names, prices, ratings)
- Stores the results in a **DataTable** variable (`ExtractDataTable`)

### 🔹 Export to Excel
- Opens or creates `ScrapedData.xlsx`
- Writes the `ExtractDataTable` content to `Sheet1` starting from cell `A1`
- Includes column headers

## Example Output (ScrapedData.xlsx)

| Product Name         | Price    | Rating |
|----------------------|--------- |------- |
| Example Product 1    | ₹1,299   | 4.5★   |
| Example Product 2    | ₹2,499   | 4.2★   |
| Example Product 3    | ₹999     | 4.8★   |

*(Actual data depends on the website scraped)*
